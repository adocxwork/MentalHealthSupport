That's crazy, my brother's cat did the same thing with me last year when I got the flu. She's usually pretty distant	1,27	ees470u
I agree. I've been passively thinking that the left and right axis is irrelevant. Its north and south that divides	4	ed1qmrz
[NAME]*, and do you expect them to get fired literally in the middle of the season?	7	edvdqxv
It's a fact tho. So your accusations are simply based on misinformation.	3	edeltfq

It depends... I understand if someone banns the champ in ranked.. but in normals i agree	4	ef69z72
Wanting America to be better does not mean hating America. We can do better than [NAME]. He’s an embarrassment to the entire country.	12	eeapyt5
