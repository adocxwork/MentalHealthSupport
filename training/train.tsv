Typically the speeches come from a functional adult. The Idiot is an unindicted co-conspirator with a visible personality disorder. Feigning normalcy is part of what's wrong.	3,25	edktvfj
[NAME] has no jump at all. If he’s injured he should sit and get better.	4,5,27	eeent2h

In shock and was more concerned about my kid tbh. Now off course I wish I'd sued the arse off her for emotional distress.	26	eee9x1k
Nothing seems to intrigue or satisfy me only drugs and thats sad.	14,19	edvdslq_aug390
Flat out getting our ass kicked. Gotta give it to Memphis, they have just shut us down	2,9,12	ef86622_aug196

Short and simple... More embarrassing being a janitor or being in the unemployment line?	12	eecly5v_aug187
I considered that they might be doing that, actually...but I googled it and it didn’t seem to be true.	22,27	eff1mdx
I love you	18	eczxapo

Very, but I also never really liked home to begin with so it's been more of a relief.	10,23	eeisn3f_aug612
He appeals to the conversation. Basically doesn’t have a firm stance on anything of much importance and will flip flop based on his guest.	10	eesfjhh
[NAME] will be proud of people who share links from conspiracy websites in order to “defend” him. Hahahahaha	27	ed2xbda

Chickens would definitely die out, sheep might have a small chance at surviving, cows might have a slightly higher chance, but pigs would surely survive.	4	eef5x95
Everyone knew that deal was stupid from the moment it happened, [NAME] was like 38. We just have to pray he learned from that	5,10	ef0tdjb
You're welcome	15	eczxdth
[NAME] gets so many chances but just can’t hit the net. I don’t get it.	6	eduuumf
To be fair the lore is so nonexistent other than on Ubi’s site you could probably just pretend that’s the case anyways.	27	ee9eb16
You ladies are awesome. Thank you all so much for your kind words.	0,15	ee8kxsf
Both sides have extended offers to end the shutdown since it has started, I think it's disingenuous to act like this is completely one sided.	27	eevei0u
Let's say he quits or is fired (we already know neither will happen). Who the [NAME] would we pick to replace him?	6,7	ed3re3h
I feel like itll be less like we imagine but similar to the magabomber. Just some crazy dude living in his van	27	efamoz5

I have a bad feeling about this.	14	eeo2nvr_aug345
Not that I fully disagree but this seems a lot more like a rant that you want people to back you up on rather than a genuine question.	3,22	efct3kc
When the caterer found out [NAME] was going to pay the bill out of his own pocket, perhaps they declined the honour.	10	ee3n6xl
One can only dream about having such a good team one day again. Now we have Sansores y Vilchis no mames haha.	1,8	eec55pt_aug293

I merely suggested he see a doctor based on some weird symptoms he is having that cause him to not be able to interact with others very well.	5	efgcsvi
No, but even if you did, you'll find nothing special.	20	eczttpz
this off season is dark and full of terrors	14	edfr8bs_aug392
They wanted all the shows to be based in New York. Seems like a weird reason but that’s what [NAME] said	8	eeavtgp

Ohhh sorry. I got it now. Thanks bruv	15,24	ef1pd0s
I will be surprised if this actually has an impact. Just a few statements about the importance of the commitment to defeat ISIS and the withdrawal will continue.	26	ee74f8a

Oh sorry if I seemed dishonest. I hope you can make it through your mourning.	20,24	ee359hq

It's not something i'm proud of, but I definitely fucked up that day.	11	edh3jat_aug233
[NAME]. I really loved your hustle for 35 yards. That's why it was so hard to cut you.	4,18	edj79pa

Oh sweet! From their website I wasn't sure what age group it was geared toward.	6	eds1532
[NAME] wrote a really technical and really awesome article in the Athletic about this game. Holy shit haha worth reading if you are a ball nerd.	0,1	ee1utpx

Ah, this may explain all the untimely heart attack deaths we hear about for those who opposed the state or whatnot	16	efb59w0_aug1169
Sounds like fun, actually?	6	ed4l4wr
>It is tailored to your viewing history. That's fairly common knowledge nowadays isn't it? Weird thing for the comic to point out.	7,12	efdqtwz_aug287

I wonder how fat activism intersects with animal rights tho.	26	ee43mw0
I saw at least one user on this forum talking badly about [NAME] for missing playing time.	10	ee8aeqe
"Also because someone could then be either ""An Asexual"" or ""A Sexual"", and that would be confusing out loud. "	6	eesxpbt
It's rape after they've both consented? You're what's wrong with society today, try to be less of a dipshit going forward.	2	edlwo74

You forgot [NAME] and [NAME] as [NAME] and [NAME] in the 2003 *Battlestar Galactica*, which was spectacular.	26	ed2w1o5

There's a guy that died after he let a horse do that. He'd probably have survived if he sought medical attention sooner.	16,25	edzihwd_aug319
This definitely sounds like bipolar mania or a schizophrenic episode. I hope he gets some help.	20	eefxvog
My goodness. Your such a fucking manchild.	2,3	ed789j9
Anyways. Weird behaviour of it when it was happening is that it hid itself when the video was paused then reappeared as the video continued.	3,27	ed44vm9

I'm so excited for this game!! 😄	13	eemdsqk_aug74
Well then I feel sorry for men for being such incontrolable sexual beasts I guess. My original answer was sincere, I can't speak for others though.	3,24	ed51srg_aug37
Same pigs who bombed a mosque full of kids learning Quran. In Shaa'Allah those terrorists will burn in hell	2	ed3mk68

Who is afraid of who here? The shower or you?	6	ee18p09

Today I saved lots and lots of people from being raped by me. Now I really *do* feel created in [NAME] image.	21	eebeduu_aug520
